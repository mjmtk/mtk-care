# Task ID: 8
# Title: Modify Task Model for Team Assignment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the Task model to include team assignment functionality
# Details:
In apps/tasks/models.py, add assigned_team field as ForeignKey to Team model (on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, related_name='tasks'). Import Team model from teams.models. Create and run migration for this change using makemigrations and migrate commands.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Task model can be created with assigned_team, test relationship works correctly, and migration applies without issues
