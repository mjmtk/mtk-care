# Task ID: 2
# Title: Rename Router in apps/users/api.py
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Rename the existing router to users_router for better clarity and separation of concerns
# Details:
In apps/users/api.py, rename the existing 'router' variable to 'users_router'. Update all references to this router throughout the file. Ensure the router is properly configured with APIRouter() and maintains all existing user-related endpoints. Update any import statements or references in other files that might reference this router.

# Test Strategy:
Run existing user endpoint tests to ensure functionality is preserved. Verify that all user CRUD operations still work correctly. Test import statements and router references in dependent modules.
