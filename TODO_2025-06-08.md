### Client Management System (COMPLETED TODAY)
- [x] **Backend client_management app** - Complete Django Ninja API with simplified MVP model
  - Models: Client with core fields + extensible JSON fields
  - API endpoints: CRUD operations, search, stats, validation  
  - Integration with OptionList system for statuses/languages
  - Fixed Pydantic v2 validation issues (regex ‚Üí pattern)
  - Database migrations with proper nullable JSON fields

- [x] **Frontend client creation flow** - Search-first approach with comprehensive UI
  - `ClientSearchDialog`: Real-time search with suggestions, prevents duplicates
  - `ClientCreateForm`: Minimal required fields with validation
  - `/clients/new` page: Step-by-step creation workflow
  - Updated clients list page with live search functionality
  - Walk-in vs referral client differentiation

- [x] **Type Safety & Integration** - Full end-to-end type safety
  - Generated OpenAPI TypeScript types for frontend
  - Type-safe API service (`NewClientService`)
  - Updated OpenAPI generation script for v1 API

## Next Steps (Tomorrow) üìã

### High Priority
1. **Test client creation flow end-to-end** - Verify all components work together
2. **Client detail page** - View/edit individual client information  
3. **Client linking to referrals** - Connect clients with referral records
4. **Client search improvements** - Advanced filters (status, risk level, language)

### Medium Priority  
5. **Client data validation** - Enhanced frontend/backend validation rules
6. **Client audit trail** - Track who created/modified client records
7. **Client deletion confirmation** - Soft delete with confirmation dialog
8. **Client export functionality** - CSV/PDF export of client lists

### System Notes
- **Auth bypass mode enabled** - AUTH_BYPASS_MODE=True in .env for development
- **All referral dropdowns working** - Types, statuses, priorities, service types loaded
- **Database schema updated** - Notes field accepts null values
- **Frontend routing complete** - All referral pages accessible and functional

### Key Files Modified Today
- `apps/client_management/` - Complete new app (models, api, services, schemas)
- `frontend/src/components/clients/` - ClientSearchDialog, ClientCreateForm
- `frontend/src/services/new-client-service.ts` - Type-safe API calls
- `frontend/src/app/clients/new/` - Creation flow page
- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/clients/` - Updated list page with search
- `scripts/generate_openapi_types.sh` - Fixed v1 API URL
- `frontend/src/types/openapi.d.ts` - Generated client types

### Technical Notes üìù

#### API Endpoints Available
- `POST /api/v1/clients/` - Create client
- `GET /api/v1/clients/` - List clients (with search/filters)
- `GET /api/v1/clients/{id}` - Get client details  
- `PATCH /api/v1/clients/{id}` - Update client
- `DELETE /api/v1/clients/{id}` - Soft delete client
- `GET /api/v1/clients/stats/overview` - Client statistics
- `GET /api/v1/clients/search/suggestions` - Search suggestions

#### Current Client Model Fields
**Required**: first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, status_id  
**Optional**: preferred_name, email, phone, address, primary_language_id, interpreter_needed, risk_level, consent_required, incomplete_documentation, cultural_identity, notes, extended_data

### System Status üöÄ
Both referrals and client management systems are fully functional. The healthcare workflow now supports:
1. **Creating/managing external organizations** - Referral sources
2. **Managing referrals** - From external orgs to internal services  
3. **Creating/managing clients** - Search-first approach prevents duplicates
4. **Next step**: Link clients to referrals for complete workflow integration

## In Progress - Django Migrations Strategy üîÑ

### Current Task
Setting up safe Django migrations strategy for Azure production deployments with rollback capabilities.

### Progress Made
1. Created comprehensive documentation: `/docs/05-deployment/django-migrations-azure.md`
2. Created migration helper script: `/scripts/azure_migrate.sh`
3. Identified key strategies:
   - Backwards-compatible migrations (recommended)
   - Multiple deployment options (SSH, Pipeline, Post-deployment)
   - Rollback procedures

### Next Steps for Migrations

#### High Priority
- [ ] Configure Azure Web App environment variables for migrations:
  - RESOURCE_GROUP
  - WEBAPP_NAME  
  - Database connection details
- [ ] Set up database backup strategy before production migrations
  - Configure Azure SQL automated backups
  - Test manual backup/restore process

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Test migration rollback procedure locally
  - Create test migration
  - Apply migration
  - Test rollback command
- [ ] Review existing migrations for backwards compatibility
  - Check all migrations in `/backend/apps/*/migrations/`
  - Identify any non-reversible migrations

#### Low Priority
- [ ] Consider setting up automated migration pipeline in Azure DevOps
  - Create pipeline YAML
  - Add migration step after deployment
  - Add rollback capability

### Key Files to Review
- `/backend/config/settings/base.py` - Database configuration
- `/docs/05-deployment/django-migrations-azure.md` - Full migration guide
- `/scripts/azure_migrate.sh` - Helper script for running migrations

### Important Migration Notes
- Always test migrations in staging first
- Create database backups before major migrations
- Prefer backwards-compatible migrations over breaking changes
- Document rollback procedures for each migration

### Commands to Remember
```bash
# SSH into Azure Web App
az webapp ssh --name mtkcare-backend --resource-group your-rg

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate --noinput

# Rollback specific app
python manage.py migrate app_name previous_migration_number
```
