# Task ID: 9
# Title: Update Task Pydantic Schemas
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify Task schemas to include team assignment fields
# Details:
Update Task Pydantic schemas in apps/tasks/schemas.py to include assigned_team_id field. Add optional assigned_team_id to TaskCreateSchema and TaskUpdateSchema. Update TaskSchema (response) to include assigned_team information with nested team data if assigned.

# Test Strategy:
Test schema validation with assigned_team_id, verify serialization includes team data when present, and test with null/empty team assignments
