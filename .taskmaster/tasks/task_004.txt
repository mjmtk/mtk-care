# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Pydantic schemas for Team API serialization and validation
# Details:
Create teams/schemas.py with Pydantic schemas: TeamSchema (response) with all Team fields including nested User data for manager/members, TeamCreateSchema (input) with name, optional description and manager_id, TeamUpdateSchema (input) with optional name, description, manager_id, and is_active, TeamMemberSchema with user_id field. Use proper type hints and validation.

# Test Strategy:
Write tests to validate schema serialization/deserialization with valid and invalid data, ensuring proper validation errors are raised
