# Development Documentation

This section contains all developer-focused documentation including coding standards, best practices, and implementation guides.

## Overview

Development documentation is organized by technology stack and cross-cutting concerns like authentication. Each section contains practical guides for implementing features and following project conventions.

## Documentation Sections

### [Backend Development](./backend/)
Django and Django Ninja implementation guides.

**Key topics:**
- Django Ninja best practices
- API endpoint development
- App refactoring procedures
- Testing guidelines

### [Frontend Development](./frontend/)
Next.js and React implementation guides.

**Key topics:**
- Next.js conventions and patterns
- ShadCN UI component usage
- OpenAPI type generation
- State management patterns

### [Authentication](./authentication/)
Authentication and authorization implementation.

**Key topics:**
- System overview and architecture
- Backend JWT implementation
- Azure AD integration
- Development bypass mode

## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
- Clone repository and install dependencies
- Configure environment variables
- Set up local database
- Configure authentication (bypass mode for development)

### 2. Feature Development
- Create feature branch from main
- Follow coding conventions for frontend/backend
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Code Review Process
- Submit pull request with clear description
- Ensure all tests pass
- Address review feedback
- Merge to main branch

### 4. Testing Standards
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for UI elements
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows

## Code Quality Standards

### General Principles
- Follow SOLID principles
- Write self-documenting code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Comment complex business logic

### Backend Standards (Python/Django)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints throughout
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Use Django best practices

### Frontend Standards (TypeScript/React)
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write accessible components
- Follow React best practices

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- See [troubleshooting section](../06-troubleshooting/) for specific problems
- Authentication and authorization issues
- API integration problems
- Database migration conflicts

### Development Tools
- Django Debug Toolbar for backend debugging
- React Developer Tools for frontend debugging
- VS Code extensions for enhanced development
- Browser network tools for API debugging

## Performance Considerations

### Backend Performance
- Database query optimization
- Proper use of Django ORM
- Caching strategies
- API response optimization

### Frontend Performance
- Component optimization with React.memo
- Proper use of useCallback and useMemo
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization and caching
