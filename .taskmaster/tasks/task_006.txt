# Task ID: 6
# Title: Update Imports and References
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Update all import statements and references throughout the codebase to reflect the new router structure
# Details:
Search the entire codebase for any references to the old router structure. Update import statements in test files, other API modules, and any configuration files that reference the routers. Ensure all references to users_router and roles_router are correctly updated. Update any documentation or comments that reference the old structure.

# Test Strategy:
Run the full test suite to ensure no import errors or broken references. Perform a codebase search for any remaining references to the old router names. Test the complete API functionality to ensure all endpoints work correctly with the new structure.
