# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Team CRUD API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Django Ninja API endpoints for team management operations
# Details:
Create teams/api.py with Django Ninja router. Implement endpoints: POST / (create team, admin only), GET / (list teams, authenticated users), GET /{team_id}/ (retrieve team, authenticated users), PUT /{team_id}/ (update team, admin or team manager), DELETE /{team_id}/ (soft delete via is_active=False, admin only). Use proper authentication decorators and permission checks.

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests for each endpoint covering success cases, permission checks, and error handling. Test with different user roles (admin, team manager, regular user)
