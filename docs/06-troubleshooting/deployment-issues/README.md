This section contains troubleshooting guides for deployment-related problems in the MTK-Care system.

## Common Deployment Issues

### [Azure Deployment Issues](./azure-issues.md)
Common problems and solutions for Azure Web App deployment.

**Common symptoms:**
- Application fails to start in Azure
- Environment variable configuration issues
- Database connection problems
- Authentication and authorization failures

## Deployment Troubleshooting Process

### 1. Initial Diagnosis
- Check Azure Web App logs in Azure Portal
- Verify environment variable configuration
- Test database connectivity
- Confirm authentication setup

### 2. Common Problem Areas

#### Environment Configuration
- Missing or incorrect environment variables
- Database connection string formatting
- Azure AD configuration parameters
- SSL certificate configuration

#### Application Startup
- Python/Node.js version compatibility
- Dependency installation issues
- Static file serving problems
- Application entry point configuration

#### Database Issues
- Database server connectivity
- Migration script execution
- Database permissions and access
- Connection pool configuration

#### Authentication Problems
- Azure AD application registration
- Redirect URI configuration
- Token validation issues
- Role and permission mapping

### 3. Debugging Steps

1. **Check Application Logs**
   - Review startup logs in Azure Portal
   - Enable detailed error logging
   - Monitor real-time log streams

2. **Verify Configuration**
   - Validate all environment variables
   - Test database connections
   - Confirm Azure AD settings

3. **Test Components Individually**
   - Test backend API endpoints
   - Verify frontend accessibility
   - Check authentication flows

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Review Application Insights data
   - Check resource utilization
   - Monitor response times

## Prevention Strategies

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Authentication tested in staging
- [ ] SSL certificates validated
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

### Staging Environment
- Use staging environment to test deployments
- Validate all functionality before production
- Test with production-like data volumes
- Verify third-party integrations

### Automated Testing
- Implement deployment pipeline testing
- Use infrastructure as code
- Automate environment configuration
- Test rollback procedures
