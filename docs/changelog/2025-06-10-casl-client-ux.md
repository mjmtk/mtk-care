# 2025-06-10: CASL Permissions & Client UX Improvements

## Overview
Major implementation of comprehensive RBAC system with database-driven roles, CASL permissions, and significant client management UX improvements.


## Major Features

### Database-Driven Role Management System
- Replace hardcoded role enums with dynamic database-driven role system
- Migrate entire permission system to CASL for granular access control
- Implement 4-phase role migration plan with 8 default system roles
- Add role-based dashboard widget system with automatic visibility control
- Create comprehensive permission architecture with subject-action model

### CASL Permission System
- Define comprehensive subjects (Client, Referral, Analytics, etc.) and actions
- Implement attribute-based access control with context conditions
- Create PermissionGuard component replacing legacy RoleGuard
- Add role-based navigation and feature visibility

### Role Management Infrastructure
- Add enhanced Role model with permissions, levels, and custom attributes
- Create database migration with default roles (Superuser, Manager, Practitioner, etc.)
- Implement role switching functionality for testing different RBAC scenarios
- Add dynamic role provider with API integration

## Client Management Improvements

### Client Creation Workflow Fix
- Fix client creation workflow to display actual client data vs hardcoded template
- Implement unified client service handling both real API and mock data
- Add proper timeline generation for new clients with creation entries
- Preserve mock template (Aroha Wiremu) for continued design work

### Timeline & Data Management
- Create smart client ID detection (UUID/numeric vs mock IDs)
- Generate appropriate timeline entries for newly created clients
- Maintain fallback to mock data for development and design work
- Fix data transformation issues with simplified client model

## Error Handling & UX Improvements

### Comprehensive Error Boundaries
- Add comprehensive error boundaries preventing unstyled application crashes
- Implement page-level and component-level error fallbacks with recovery options
- Add styled error messages with multiple recovery actions (retry, reload, go home)
- Protect critical pages (referrals, clients) with specific error handling

### Build Quality & Performance
- Fix critical React Hook dependency warnings and TypeScript build errors
- Reduce build warnings from 200+ to 158 through systematic cleanup
- Resolve hoisting issues with `useCallback` and `useEffect` dependencies
- Fix TypeScript type conflicts with session object properties

## Technical Infrastructure

### API & Authentication
- Resolve API endpoint standardization with v1 versioning
- Fix authentication type conflicts and session management issues
- Add development auth bypass mode with production security controls
- Handle frontend/backend auth bypass settings for development vs production

### Production Readiness
- Create deployment checklist with environment variable documentation
- Document critical production settings (API URLs, auth bypass, secrets)
- Add comprehensive CORS and security configuration guidance
- Ensure proper separation of development and production authentication modes

## Documentation

### Architecture Documentation
- Document permission architecture and role-based widget system
- Add comprehensive authentication and dynamic roles documentation
- Create deployment guide with critical production settings
- Document widget permission system for dashboard customization

### Development Guides
- Add troubleshooting guides for common deployment issues
- Document role switching and testing methodologies
- Create comprehensive environment variable reference
- Add security best practices for production deployment

## Files Changed

### Backend Changes
- `apps/users/models.py` - Enhanced Role model with permissions
- `apps/users/migrations/0006_populate_default_roles.py` - Default role creation
- `config/settings/base.py` - Auth bypass configuration
- `apps/authentication/middleware_bypass.py` - Development auth bypass

### Frontend Changes
- `src/auth/ability.ts` - CASL ability definitions and role-based permissions
- `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts` - Dynamic permission system
- `src/components/auth/PermissionGuard.tsx` - CASL-based permission guards
- `src/services/unified-client-service.ts` - Smart client data handling
- `src/components/error-boundary.tsx` - Comprehensive error handling
- `src/app/clients/[id]/page.tsx` - Client detail page improvements

### Documentation
- `docs/04-development/permissions/README.md` - Permission system overview
- `docs/04-development/authentication/dynamic-roles.md` - Role system documentation
- `docs/04-development/dashboard/widget-system.md` - Widget permissions
- `docs/03-architecture/permissions-architecture.md` - System design
- `deployment-checklist.md` - Production deployment guide

## Breaking Changes
- **Role Enum Removal**: Hardcoded `AppRoles` enum replaced with database roles
- **Permission System**: Legacy role-based checks replaced with CASL permissions
- **Auth Bypass**: New environment variables required for bypass mode control

## Migration Notes
- Run database migrations to create default roles: `python manage.py migrate`
- Update environment variables for auth bypass mode in production
- Test role switching functionality with new dynamic role system
- Verify CASL permissions work correctly for all user types

## Next Steps
- Phase 4: Add admin interface for role management
- Implement additional analytics permissions for future features
- Expand widget system with more dashboard components
- Add audit logging for role and permission changes
