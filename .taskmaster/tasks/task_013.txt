# Title: Create Team Dashboard Views
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement API endpoints for team-specific dashboard data
# Details:
Create teams/dashboard.py with endpoints: GET /{team_id}/dashboard/ (team overview with task counts, member list, recent activities), GET /{team_id}/tasks/ (tasks assigned to team with filtering options). Include statistics like total tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks, and team member activity summaries.

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard data accuracy, verify task counts match actual data, test with different team sizes and task volumes, and validate performance
