# Task ID: 4
# Title: Move Role Endpoints to Roles Router
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify and move all role-related CRUD operations from users_router to the new roles_router
# Details:
Identify all role-related endpoints currently in users_router (likely including GET /roles/, POST /roles/, PUT /roles/{id}, DELETE /roles/{id}, etc.). Move these endpoint definitions to roles_router. Update all decorator references from @users_router to @roles_router for role endpoints. Ensure all role-related dependencies, models, and schemas are properly imported and accessible.

# Test Strategy:
Test all moved role endpoints to ensure they function correctly under the new router. Verify CRUD operations for roles (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Test endpoint responses and status codes match expected behavior.
