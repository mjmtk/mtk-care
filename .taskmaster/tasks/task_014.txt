# Priority: medium
# Description: Create migration script to transition from legacy department system to teams
# Details:
Create a Django management command in teams/management/commands/migrate_departments.py to migrate existing department data to teams. Map department names to team names, department heads to team managers, and department members to team members. Handle any data conflicts and provide logging for the migration process.

# Test Strategy:
Test migration with sample department data, verify data integrity after migration, test rollback procedures, and validate that no data is lost during transition
