# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create New Roles Router
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new roles_router in apps/users/api.py specifically for role-related endpoints
# Details:
In apps/users/api.py, create a new APIRouter instance named 'roles_router'. Configure it with appropriate tags=['roles'] and prefix settings. Initialize the router with: roles_router = APIRouter(tags=['roles']). Ensure proper imports for APIRouter from fastapi.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the new router is properly instantiated and can be imported. Test that the router configuration is correct and doesn't conflict with existing routers.
