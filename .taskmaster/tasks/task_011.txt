# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Team Permission System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create permission classes and decorators for team-based access control
# Details:
Create teams/permissions.py with custom permission classes: IsAdminOrTeamManager (allows admin or manager of specific team), IsTeamMember (allows team members), IsAdminOnly (admin-only actions). Implement helper functions to check if user is team manager or member. Apply these permissions to appropriate API endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test permission classes with different user roles and team memberships, verify access is properly restricted, and test edge cases like inactive teams or removed members
