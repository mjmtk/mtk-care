# Task ID: 10
# Title: Update Task API Endpoints for Team Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify Task API endpoints to handle team assignment and filtering
# Details:
Update Task API endpoints in apps/tasks/api.py to handle assigned_team_id in create/update operations. Add query parameter filtering by assigned_team to list endpoint. Update task creation/update logic to validate team assignment and ensure proper permissions (only team members or admins can assign tasks to teams).

# Test Strategy:
Test task creation/update with team assignment, verify filtering by team works correctly, test permission checks for team assignment, and validate error handling
