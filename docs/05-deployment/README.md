# Deployment Documentation

This section contains documentation for deploying and maintaining the MTK-Care system in production environments.

## Overview

The MTK-Care system is designed for deployment on Microsoft Azure using Azure Web Apps for both frontend and backend components. This section covers deployment procedures, environment configuration, and operational maintenance.

## Documentation Files

### [Azure Deployment Guide](./azure-deployment-guide.md)
Complete guide for deploying MTK-Care to Azure from scratch.

### [Post Deployment Tasks](./post-deployment-tasks.md)
Essential configuration and verification steps after deployment.

**Key topics:**
- Azure resource setup and configuration
- Environment variable configuration
- Database setup and migration
- Authentication and authorization setup
- SSL certificate configuration
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Deployment Architecture

### Azure Resources
- **Azure Web App**: Frontend (Next.js application)
- **Azure Web App**: Backend (Django application)
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Azure Storage Account**: File storage and static assets
- **Azure Active Directory**: Authentication and authorization
- **Azure Application Insights**: Monitoring and analytics

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with SQLite and auth bypass
- **Staging**: Azure environment mirroring production
- **Production**: Full Azure deployment with all security measures

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
1. Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
2. Azure CLI installed and configured
3. Access to domain for custom URL configuration
4. SSL certificates for HTTPS

### Deployment Steps
1. **Resource Provisioning**: Create Azure resources
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure environment variables
3. **Database Setup**: Create and migrate database
4. **Application Deployment**: Deploy frontend and backend
5. **Authentication Setup**: Configure Azure AD integration
6. **SSL Configuration**: Set up HTTPS with custom domain
7. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure Application Insights
8. **Post-Deployment Testing**: Verify all functionality

## Environment Management
