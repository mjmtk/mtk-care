# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Team Member Management API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create API endpoints for adding/removing team members
# Details:
Add to teams/api.py: POST /{team_id}/members/ (add member, admin or team manager), DELETE /{team_id}/members/{user_id}/ (remove member, admin or team manager), GET /{team_id}/members/ (list members, authenticated users). Implement proper validation to prevent duplicate additions and handle non-existent users gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Test member addition/removal with various user permissions, verify duplicate prevention, test with invalid user IDs, and ensure proper error responses
